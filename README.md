## **What is this?**
This project contains all the Pokémon HOME sprites. These sprites are only used for a personal Pokédex project.

Most of the sprites were obtained from [PokéJungle](https://pokejungle.net/).

Missing and shiny locked sprites were obtained from the [SuperEffective-Assets](https://github.com/supeffective/assets). Check out their website here: https://supereffective.gg

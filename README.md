## **What is this?**
This project consumes data from the [SuperEffective-Assets](https://github.com/itsjavi/supereffective-assets) repo. These C# projects take their data and convert into a format that I use for a personal Pok√©dex project.

That group deserves all of the credit for gathering the data. Check out their website here: https://supereffective.gg

Currently, all of the data in this project is derived from their repo.
